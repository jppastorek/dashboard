# dashboard
Admin Dashboard project for The Odin Project


This is an exercise to use CSS Grid for just about all layout. I did use Flexbox for a couple of items. In the exercise, it is not necessary to make the page responsive, as that will be covered in future lessons. However, I decided to make the courses respond to viewport size.

The design is a clone of an app called Canvas that I use at my school.
